### Project 1 - Finite Labryinth
  
  A simple 2D Roguelike Space Shooter (prototype) where the player must clear 3 levels in total, and the goal for each level is to simply destroy the required number of enemy ships. Clearing each incrementing level rewards the player with powerups to tackle the stronger enemies. The level environment, enemy ships, and the player are mostly randomised to provide the player a finite amount of new experiences.

The combat gameplay, shooting enemy ships but the player has to be careful when taking on many ships as they must maintain their resources (health, energy, armour) well. To summarise the player's resources, the health is tied to the armour in which you only take health damage when the armour is depleted, and the armour is the only one with damage reduction. Lastly, the player's energy is required when moving faster (from walking to running) and for firing and dodging projectiles.
